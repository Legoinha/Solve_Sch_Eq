**TODO:**

currently **units are a mess** through the code.
some potentials require natural units ehile other are writen in SI units. 
we should make this uniform to ensure better consistency and a more smoth workflow.

How to normalize these wavefucntions ?
Also what is the best range to plot them ? this means **balacing precisons vs computing time**

**Test** the **well potential** prediction for **other particles** that are well known like the proton or the alpha. 
This will give us more trust in our results for the X3872.
A first test for the JPsi\(2S) is implemented but is not yet finished.


Write the part of the code that extracts the average R from the Wave function.
